These are some HackerRank solved problems by me to keep practicing challenges and explore more python functions. Other learning notes here:

Deque common use cases:
- Limited memory of recent items: logs, errors, performance metrics, last few visited web pages, recently opened files, or undo/redo actions.

- Managing a fixed number of connections in a server

- Exchange data between threads because you can append and pop safely with them.

- Sliding Window Algorithms like calculating moving averages or finding maximum values within a specific window over a sequence of data.

- Scenarios where you have a producer generating data faster than a consumer can process it, or when you need to smooth out irregular data flows. 

- Audio and video streaming to ensure the content can start before the whole file have been sent.

- Real time services
